My first thought was to store the corresponding files directly in OneDrive. This should allow me to have my profiles backed up at any time. Unfortunately the OneDrive sync client always reported an annoying message. "The sync cannot be performed because this file (or more than one) is open in another program."
To save my profiles nevertheless I decided to copy the relevant files automatically into my desired OneDrive directory when I logged in.
